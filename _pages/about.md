## About me

I earned a B.S. in Theoretical Mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/), with a focus on ring theory, along with a dance concentration. I then completed an M.S. at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) and am currently a PhD candidate at MIT in [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/), working in [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/)'s group.

## Current research interests

My research focuses on improving variational inference methods. I use techniques from machine learning, probabilistic programming, and statistical theory to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical application.
