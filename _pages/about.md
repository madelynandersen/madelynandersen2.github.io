## About me

I earned a B.S. in Theoretical Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College, with a focus on ring theory, along with a dance concentration. I then completed an M.S. at MIT and am currently a PhD candidate at MIT.

## Current research interests

My research focuses on improving variational inference methods. I use techniques from machine learning, probabilistic programming, and statistical theory to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical application.
