    <p>
      Outside of my research pursuits, I’m a competitive dog sports trainer and an avid ballroom dancer.
      Training dogs for high-energy competitions keeps me active and practices the values of patience,
      discipline, and adaptability—traits I carry into my work. Whether I’m refining algorithms in the lab
      or running an agility course, I believe in bringing a spirit of curiosity and enthusiasm to everything I do.
